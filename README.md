## Introduction to Systems Biology classes 

This repository is part of the Introduction to Systems Biology (SB) course material.  

I hope you find the slides useful:  

[Class 01](https://rushalz.github.io/Intro_Systems_Biology/slides/Aula01_IntroSB.pdf) - Introduction to SB. Overlaps a lot with an introduction to Bioinformatics. 

[Class 02](https://rushalz.github.io/Intro_Systems_Biology/slides/Aula02_Components_WGCNA.pdf) - The basics of networks plus the WGCNA method, step by step. 

[Class 03](https://rushalz.github.io/Intro_Systems_Biology/slides/Aula03_Types_Networks.pdf) - Overview of network Medicine. 

As highlighted in the slides, I created the content based on a series of papers and books :books:! 

Hands-on tutorials: 

- WGCNA for bulk RNASeq data: [MyND monocytes](https://rushalz.github.io/Intro_Systems_Biology/WGCNA_rnaseq_monocytes.html). Navarro et al. Nat aging, 2021.

- WGCNA for bulk RNASeq data: [Thoracic spinal cord](https://rushalz.github.io/Intro_Systems_Biology/WGCNA_rnaseq.html). Humphrey et al. Nat Neuroscience, 2022.
